End Goal: a phone (Android and iPhone support!) that calculates the contractual obligations for configurable set of vendors, including hourly rates, accounting for Canadian Federal Holidays, in accordance with the standing offers.

Requirements: 1) - allows the user to enter start and end dates using a UI and simple calendar interface, 2) calculates the number of business days and hours between those dates, 3) allows the user to specify an hourly rate (which changes between November 11 and November 12 - allow this to be user configurable) - alternately, the user may enter a vendor and the app will use that for the hourly rate
4) outputs a full caclulation including number of business days, billable hours (at 7.5 hours per day) calculates the total value of the contract, calculates taxes (at 13% optional) and splits calculations by fiscal year if and when a contract goes outside the FY.
