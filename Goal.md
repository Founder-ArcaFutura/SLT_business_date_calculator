# SLT Business Date Calculator

## Problem
Case Managers at DND must calculate contract values based on start/end dates, business days, and variable hourly rates.  
Manual calculations are slow, inconsistent, and error-prone, especially around federal holidays and fiscal year transitions.

## Solution
A cross-platform date calculator that:
- Accounts for Canadian federal holidays
- Calculates billable days/hours automatically
- Supports vendor-specific rates
- Splits contract totals across fiscal years
- Provides transparent, auditable outputs

## Impact
Reduces calculation time from ~20 minutes to under 30 seconds.  
Eliminates common arithmetic and calendar logic errors.  
Standardizes contract assessments across teams.
